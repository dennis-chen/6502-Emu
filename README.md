# 6502-Emu
A 6502 Emulator written in C!

Made as a final project for Software Systems at Olin. Read the wiki for the full breakdown.

To play Snake: run the shell script (runsnake.sh). Due to keyboard library limitations you need to click/focus back onto the original terminal when the game window opens. Control the snake with WASD (corresponding to up left down right)
